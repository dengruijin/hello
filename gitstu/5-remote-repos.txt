1.you have an empty repository on github, and have a git repository(with many files) on localhost
	if you want to assosiate the two repo ,do as follow on local repository:
	$ git remote add origin git@github.com:michaelliao/learngit.git
	$ git push -u origin master  # -u option make master to track origin/master
	when next time you push code, you need not the "-u" option
	$ git push origin master
	
	
2.you has a non empty on github, you can just clone it to localhost
	$ git clone git@github.com:michaelliao/gitskills.git
	
$ git remote -v				#list the info of remote repositories

################# branch on remote repository#######################
$ git push origin master	# push local branch "master" to remote repo:origin
$ git push origin dev		# push local branch "dev" to remote repo:origin

when you clone a remote repository, git create only "master" branch on local repository
if you want to see other branch, do as below:

	$ git checkout -b dev origin/dev	#create local "dev" branch to track remote "dev" branch
or :
	$ git checkout -t origin/dev		#create local "dev" branch to track remote "dev" branch

how to set tracking infomation for local branch to track remote branch:
	$ git branch --set-upstream dev origin/dev	
or:
	$ git branch --set-upstream-to origin/dev dev
